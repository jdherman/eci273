In-class code examples for simulation, optimization, and data analysis. These examples are for instructional purposes and should not be used in production.

A few of the files are experimental ideas that haven't quite worked out, especially the synthetic streamflow topics in L9-10.

Bug reports and PRs welcome. Recent updates to the datasets may have caused errors in some of the code examples.
